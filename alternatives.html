          <h1>Alternative Options</h1>

          <p>Ever have trouble conceiving? Infertility could be tough when you want to become a parent, and it could feel like there aren't really any other options. However, there are other ways for you to become parents, even if you can't conceive "naturally". There are actually many different infertility alternatives available to you -- some that even allows you to maintain a genetic connection to your child. Not all of the options will work, but hopefully there is one that will be the right fit for you. Here are several different options that you can consider:</p>

          <h2>Fertility Restoration</h2>
          <p>Fertility drugs cause your body to release the hormones that stimulate ovulation -- they replace natural hormones and release an egg from your ovary. They’re also used in women who ovulate to try to stimulate a better egg or extra eggs. This is usually one of the first treatments that individuals tend to go through with.</p>

          <h3>Common Fertility Drugs</h3>
          <h4>Clomiphene Citrate</h4>
          <p>This is an estrogen-blocking drug. It’s taken by the mouth and stimulates ovulation by causing the hypothalamus and pituitary glands (located in your brain) to release hormones called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and LH (luteinizing hormone). These hormones trigger your ovaries to make eggs.</p>

          <h4>Gonadotropins</h4>
          <p>These injected hormones directly stimulate the ovary to produce multiple eggs. They’re known informally as injectables and are only administered through injection. Like Clomiphene citrate, they contain FSH, LH, or a combination of those hormones.</p>

          <h4>Metformin</h4>
          <p>This is used to overcome insulin resistance. Insulin could be the cause of infertility and so metformin helps improve insulin resistance, which can improve the likelihood of ovulation.</p>

          <h4>Letrozole (Femara)</h4>
          <p>This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the number of estrogen produced by the body. Letrozole is similar to clomiphene and it is taken orally. This also helps women with ovulation problems or those with unexplained infertility. However, the effect this medication has on early pregnancy isn't known yet, so it isn't used for ovulation induction as frequently as others.</p>

          <h4>Bromocriptine (Cycloset)</h4>
          <p>This is a dopamine agonist and activates the dopamine receptors. It may be used when ovulation problems are caused by excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) by the pituitary gland, which could lead to infertility.</p>

          <h2>Medical Procedures for Infertility</h2>
          <p>If fertility drugs don’t work, do not fear -- there are medical infertility options, also known as assisted reproductive technology (ART). Here are some common ways that conception is assisted medically:</p>

          <h4>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</h4>
          <p>This is probably the most common method -- IVF involves the harvesting of sperm and egg cells from each partner. The gametes are then combined for conception in a laboratory dish. Once the embryo develops, it will be transferred into the woman’s uterus for implantation. After it successfully implants, her pregnancy should proceed like any other pregnancy.</p>

          <h4>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</h4>
          <p>If harvesting an egg isn’t necessary, individuals usually go with a IUI. Sperm is collected and  “washed” to remove seminal fluid. Then it is inserted directly into the uterine cavity to attempt to induce conception.</p>

          <h4>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</h4>
          <p>This treatment is similar to the IVF process where a single sperm is inserted into a retrieved egg. This is usually used when there are male infertility problems.</p>

          <h4>Assisted Hatching</h4>
          <p>This increases the chance that an IVF-created embryo will successfully implant in a woman’s uterus. This method makes it easier for an embryo to “hatch” and implant.</p>

          <h4>Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)</h4>
          <p>Also similar to IVF, the GIFT process harvests egg and sperm. Instead of fertilizing in a laboratory dish, this method mixes sperm and egg and then implants them into the fallopian tube for fertilization.</p>

          <h4>Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT)</h4>
          <p>This is similar to the GIFT process, however the egg is fertilized before transferring to the fallopian tube.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Sperm, Egg, or Embryo Donation (Donor Insemination)</h2>
          <p>This alternative is taken when one or both of the parents’ egg or sperm are not viable to contribute to the embryo-creation process. This way, the intended parents can preserve at least one parental genetic connection to their child. </p>

          <p>This is also used for same-sex couples. An egg or sperm donation would be needed and it would correspond to the couple’s sexes.</p>
          <p>Gamete donations are also used when intended parents want to avoid passing along a genetic disease. Again, this allows at least one of the parents to maintain a genetic connection to their child.</p>
          <p>When finding a donation, intended parents have the option of receiving an anonymous or identified donor. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Surrogacy</h2>
          <p>With this method, an embryo is created by the intended parents (from their own sperm and egg or with a donor gamete) and then transferred into the uterus of a surrogate, who will carry the child for them. This is also another way for intended parents to preserve a genetic connection to their child.</p>

          <p>There are two kinds of surrogacy --  gestational and traditional. The main difference between the two is that gestational surrogacy is when the surrogate has no biological link to the baby and traditional is when the surrogate’s eggs are used, making her the biological mother of the child she carries. However,  surrogacy professionals today will only complete gestational surrogacies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Adoption</h2>
          <p>This is another option for couples where intended parents bring a non-genetically related child into their family. Here are a list of different types of adoptions:</p>

          <h4>Private Domestic Infant Adoption</h4>
          <p>In this adoption process, a pregnant woman chooses to place her child for adoption. She chooses the adoptive family, creates a relationship with them, and is able to be a part of her child’s life -- open adoption.</p>

          <h4>Foster Care Adoption</h4>
          <p>Foster care adoption is the adoption of a child in foster care whose biological parents’ rights have been terminated by a court. The child is usually adopted by the family who is fostering them -- foster-to-adopt. However, there are also families who directly adopt from foster care and don’t become foster parents first. </p>

          <h4>International Adoption</h4>
          <p>International adoption, or intercountry adoption, is the adoption of a child from another country. These children are usually adopted from orphanages and are eligible for adoption because their birth parents were unable to care for them due to financial, legal, or emotional issues. </p>
