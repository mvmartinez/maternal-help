          <h1>Alternative Options</h1>
          <p>Ever have trouble conceiving? Infertility could be tough when you want to become a parent, and it could feel like there aren't really any other options. However, there are other ways for you to become parents, even if you can't conceive "naturally". There are actually many different infertility alternatives available to you -- some that even allows you to maintain a genetic connection to your child. Not all of the options will work, but hopefully there is one that will be the right fit for you. Here are several different options that you can consider:</p>

          <h2>Fertility Restoration</h2>
          <p>Fertility drugs cause your body to release the hormones that stimulate ovulation -- they replace natural hormones and release an egg from your ovary. They’re also used in women who ovulate to try to stimulate a better egg or extra eggs. This is usually one of the first treatments that individuals tend to go through with.</p>
  
          <h3>Common Fertility Drugs</h3>
          <h4>Clomiphene Citrate</h4>
          <p>This is an estrogen-blocking drug. It’s taken by the mouth and stimulates ovulation by causing the hypothalamus and pituitary glands (located in your brain) to release hormones called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and LH (luteinizing hormone). These hormones trigger your ovaries to make eggs.</p>
          <p>Common brands: Clomid and Serophene</p>
  
          <h4>Gonadotropins</h4>
          <p>These injected hormones directly stimulate the ovary to produce multiple eggs. They’re known informally as injectables and are only administered through injection. Like Clomiphene citrate, they contain FSH, LH, or a combination of those hormones.</p>
          <p>Common brands: Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris</p>
  
          <h4>Metformin</h4>
          <p>This is used to overcome insulin resistance. Insulin could be the cause of infertility and so metformin helps improve insulin resistance, which can improve the likelihood of ovulation.</p>
          <p>Common brands:</p>
  
          <h4>Letrozole (Femara)</h4>
          <p>This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the number of estrogen produced by the body. Letrozole is similar to clomiphene and it is taken orally. This also helps women with ovulation problems or those with unexplained infertility. However, the effect this medication has on early pregnancy isn't known yet, so it isn't used for ovulation induction as frequently as others.</p>
          <p>Common brands: </p>
  
          <h4>Bromocriptine (Cycloset)</h4>
          <p>This is a dopamine agonist and activates the dopamine receptors. It may be used when ovulation problems are caused by excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) by the pituitary gland, which could lead to infertility.</p>
          <p>Common brands:</p>

          <h2>Medical Procedures for Infertility</h2>
          <p>If fertility drugs don’t work, do not fear -- there are medical infertility options, also known as assisted reproductive technology (ART). Here are some common ways that conception is assisted medically:</p>

          <h4>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</h4>
          <p>This is probably the most common method -- IVF involves the harvesting of sperm and egg cells from each partner. The gametes are then combined for conception in a laboratory dish. Once the embryo develops, it will be transferred into the woman’s uterus for implantation. After it successfully implants, her pregnancy should proceed like any other pregnancy.</p>

          <h4>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</h4>
          <p>If harvesting an egg isn’t necessary, individuals usually go with a IUI. Sperm is collected and  “washed” to remove seminal fluid. Then it is inserted directly into the uterine cavity to attempt to induce conception.</p>
          
          <h4>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</h4>
          <p>This treatment is similar to the IVF process where a single sperm is inserted into a retrieved egg. This is usually used when there are male infertility problems.</p>
          
          <h4>Assisted Hatching</h4>
          <p>This increases the chance that an IVF-created embryo will successfully implant in a woman’s uterus. This method makes it easier for an embryo to “hatch” and implant.</p>
          
          <h4>Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)</h4>
          <p>Also similar to IVF, the GIFT process harvests egg and sperm. Instead of fertilizing in a laboratory dish, this method mixes sperm and egg and then implants them into the fallopian tube for fertilization.</p>
          
          <h4>Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT)</h4>
          <p>This is similar to the GIFT process, however the egg is fertilized before transferring to the fallopian tube.</p>
