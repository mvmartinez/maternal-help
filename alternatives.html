          <h1>Alternative Options</h1>
          <p>Ever have trouble conceiving? Infertility could be tough when you want to become a parent, and it could feel like there aren't really any other options. However, there are other ways for you to become parents, even if you can't conceive "naturally". There are actually many different infertility alternatives available to you -- some that even allows you to maintain a genetic connection to your child. Not all of the options will work, but hopefully there is one that will be the right fit for you. Here are several different options that you can consider:</p>

          <h2>Fertility Restoration</h2>
          <p>Fertility drugs cause your body to release the hormones that stimulate ovulation -- they replace natural hormones and release an egg from your ovary. They’re also used in women who ovulate to try to stimulate a better egg or extra eggs.</p>
  
          <h3>Common Fertility Drugs</h3>
          <h4>Clomiphene Citrate</h4>
          <p>This is an estrogen-blocking drug. It’s taken by the mouth and stimulates ovulation by causing the hypothalamus and pituitary glands (located in your brain) to release hormones called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and LH (luteinizing hormone). These hormones trigger your ovaries to make eggs.</p>
          <p>Common brands: Clomid and Serophene</p>
  
          <h4>Gonadotropins</h4>
          <p>These injected hormones directly stimulate the ovary to produce multiple eggs. They’re known informally as injectables and are only administered through injection. Like Clomiphene citrate, they contain FSH, LH, or a combination of those hormones.</p>
          <p>Common brands: Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris</p>
  
          <h4>Metformin</h4>
          <p>This is used to overcome insulin resistance. Insulin could be the cause of infertility and so metformin helps improve insulin resistance, which can improve the likelihood of ovulation.</p>
          <p>Common brands:</p>
  
          <h4>Letrozole (Femara)</h4>
          <p>This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the number of estrogen produced by the body. Letrozole is similar to clomiphene and it is taken orally. This also helps women with ovulation problems or those with unexplained infertility. However, the effect this medication has on early pregnancy isn't known yet, so it isn't used for ovulation induction as frequently as others.</p>
          <p>Common brands include:</p>
  
          <h4>Bromocriptine (Cycloset)</h4>
          <p>This is a dopamine agonist and activates the dopamine receptors. It may be used when ovulation problems are caused by excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) by the pituitary gland, which could lead to infertility.</p>
