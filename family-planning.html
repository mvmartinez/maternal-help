        <h1>Family Planning</h1>
        <p>The purpose of family planning is to provide information and resources to women that are looking to have a baby or trying to stay safe to avoid having a baby. One of the most helpful resources has been contraceptives and how they help in the process of having a safe pregnancy. It is imperative that we have family planning incorporated into maternal health for marginalized communities because they are even more at risk due to the lack of resources in their communities. With more family planning implemented in maternal health it could help lower the maternal mortality rate. </p>
