        <h4>Options for Same-Sex Partners</h4>
        <p class="answer">If you and your partner wish to conceive biologically, there's a couple options available to you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>IUI - Intrauterine Insemination is a process that places sperm directly into the uterus. It is less invasive than IVF. It can cost between $300 to $1,000 without insurance.
          </li>
          <li>IVF -  In vitro fertilization uses a combination of medicine and a surgical procedure to help sperm fertilize an egg, and also implant the fertilized egg directly into the uterus. A single round of IVF can cost around $15,000 or more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="answer">As a disclaimer, although there is pros and cons to both procedures, it’s important to keep in mind that many people have to go through several rounds to conceive successful, remember to be patient with yourself.If neither you or your partner has the ability to carry a baby, you can also look into getting a surrogate.</p>

        <h4>Options for Trans and GNC Folks</h4>
        <p class="answer">If you want to undergo any surgery that could impact your reproductive system, but you want to have biological children later on, here are some options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Egg freezing - Because of the extensiveness of the process, it can cost from $6,000-$10,000.
          </li>
          <li>Sperm freezing - typically freezing one sample is around $786 and the storage fee is about $260 a year. Some private insurances may cover all or part of the cost of the process. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="answer">As far as time frame, there have been cases of people who froze their sperm for up to 20 years! However, an egg can be viable up to 13 years.

        <h4>Legal Fees</h4>
